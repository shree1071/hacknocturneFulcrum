## 🔐 Patient Registration (Blockchain)

![Patient Registration](./screenshots/patientregistration.png)

When a user selects **Patient** on the landing page, they are taken to the registration screen where their identity is anchored on-chain via MetaMask. Here's every element explained:

### Left Panel — Registration Form

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **MediChain AI Icon** | Blue layered logo icon confirming you're in the MediChain ecosystem |
| **"Join as Patient" Heading** | Confirms the role being registered — *Patient* |
| **Subtitle** | *"You're registering as a patient"* — clear context for the user |
| **Wallet Connected (green dot)** | Shows the MetaMask wallet is successfully connected. Displays the truncated wallet address (`0xf39Fd6e5...2266`) with a **Disconnect** button to switch accounts |
| **"Registering as Patient" Info Box** | Describes what patient access unlocks: *"You can upload reports, get AI analysis, and control data access."* — sets expectations before confirming |
| **CONFIRM IN METAMASK Button** | A prominent pink button that triggers the on-chain `registerPatient()` transaction. Clicking this opens the MetaMask popup |
| **Gas Fee Warning** | Small text below: *"This will create a blockchain transaction to register your role. Gas fees may apply."* — transparent about cost |

### Right Panel — MetaMask Transaction Popup

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **"Transfer request" Header** | MetaMask's label for the triggered smart contract call |
| **0 ETH** | Confirms this is a **zero-value transaction** — no ETH is being transferred, only the registration function is called |
| **From → To** | Shows the patient's imported wallet sending to the smart contract address (`0x5FbDB...80...`) |
| **Network: Localhost 8545** | The Hardhat local blockchain network — for demo/testing purposes |
| **Request from: localhost:3001** | The frontend app (Next.js dev server) that initiated the transaction request |
| **Network fee: ~0 ETH / $0.07** | The gas cost is minimal — just enough to write the registration to the blockchain |
| **Speed** | Transaction speed selector (configurable) |
| **Cancel / Confirm Buttons** | User can cancel or confirm the blockchain registration — clicking **Confirm** calls `registerPatient()` on `MediChainRecords.sol` and redirects to the Patient Dashboard |

> **Why blockchain registration?** Storing roles on-chain ensures that only verified, wallet-authenticated patients and doctors can interact with sensitive medical data. No central authority can modify or revoke roles without the user's private key.

## 🧠 InsForge Backend

- **Database tables**: `users`, `analyses`, `chat_history`, `access_grants`, `appointments`
- **Storage**: `medical-reports` bucket (private, patient-scoped)
- **Edge Functions**: `analyze-report`, `medical-chatbot`, `tavus-video`

## ⛓️ Smart Contract (`MediChainRecords.sol`)

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `registerPatient()` | Register the caller as a patient |
| `registerDoctor()` | Register the caller as a doctor |
| `storeRecord(hash)` | Store SHA-256 hash of a medical report on-chain |
| `grantAccess(doctor)` | Allow a doctor address to view patient records |
| `revokeAccess(doctor)` | Remove a doctor's access |
| `emergencyAccess(...)` | Log emergency access event for auditing |

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption Pipeline**: Encryption keys are manually entered and locally managed by the patient. Keys are never stored in the database or sent to the backend, ensuring absolute data privacy.
- **Local PDF Processing**: Text extraction from uploaded PDF files is handled securely in the browser using `pdfjs-dist`, preventing sensitive raw files from unnecessary transit.
- **Private Storage**: Medical reports are powerfully encrypted and stored securely in InsForge storage — only accessible to the authenticated patient.
- **On-chain Access Control**: No doctor can read records without the patient's explicit blockchain transaction.
- **Cryptographic Verification**: SHA-256 hashes stored on-chain ensure report integrity (tamper-proof verification).
- **Edge Analytics**: AI analysis leverages secure Edge Functions — raw data isn't exposed to third-party databases.

## 🔧 Requestly Integration — API Testing & Automation Suite

MediChain AI ships with a **production-grade Requestly API collection** covering all 28+ backend endpoints. This enables automated API testing, sequential workflow validation, and real-time debugging — all through Requestly's API Client and Collection Runner.

### 📦 What's Included

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/medichain-openapi.json` | Full OpenAPI v3.0.2 specification — natively importable into Requestly |
| `/docs` (FastAPI) | Auto-generated Swagger documentation during development |

### 🚀 Quick Setup

1. **Install Requestly** — Download from [requestly.com](https://requestly.com) (free tier works)
2. **Import the Collection** 
   - Open Requestly Desktop → Select **APIs** on the sidebar
   - Click **Import** → Choose **OpenAPI**
   - Upload `backend/medichain-openapi.json`
3. **Set Up Environments**
   - Select the "Environments" tab and create a new environment named `MediChain Local`
   - Add these essential variables:
     - `baseUrl`: `http://localhost:8000`
     - `testPatientWallet`: `0xTestPatient1234567890abcdef1234567890abcd`
     - `testDoctorWallet`: `0xTestDoctor1234567890abcdef1234567890abcde`
4. **Start the backend** — `cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload`
5. **Run** — Execute individual requests or use the **Collection Runner** for full automated testing

### 🧪 Test Collection Structure

```
🏥 Infrastructure          →  Health Check
🧠 AI Analysis             →  Analyze Report, Chat, Organ Analysis
🎥 Tavus AI Doctor         →  Video Generation, Status Poll, CVI Conversation
📋 Medical Records         →  Get/Update/Clone/Delete Records, Cache Check
🔐 Access Control (RBAC)   →  Grant/Get/Revoke Access
📅 Appointments            →  Create/Get/Cancel Appointments, Slot Check
👨‍⚕️ Doctor Dashboard        →  Profiles, Grants, Appointments, Notes
🧹 Test Cleanup            →  Delete test data
```

### 🔗 Chained Test Variables (Sequential Execution)

The collection uses **chained environment variables** — outputs from early requests auto-populate inputs for later ones:

```
Analyze Report → stores testAnalysisId, testRecordId
    ↓
Get Records, Update Record, Clone Record → use testRecordId
    ↓
Grant Access, Get Grants, Revoke Access → use testAnalysisId
    ↓
Create Appointment → stores testAppointmentId
    ↓
Cancel Appointment, Update Status → use testAppointmentId
    ↓
Delete Record (Cleanup) → uses testRecordId
```

### ✅ Test Coverage

Every endpoint includes post-response validation scripts that check:
- **Status codes** (200 expected for all success paths)
- **Response schema** (field types, required fields, enum values)
- **Data integrity** (risk scores in 0–100 range, urgency levels match enum, hash format correct)
- **Business logic** (cache deduplication, access grant/revoke lifecycle, appointment state machine)

### 🔄 OpenAPI Import (Alternative)

FastAPI auto-generates an OpenAPI spec at `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`. Import this directly into Requestly for auto-generated request stubs:

```
Requestly → APIs → Import → OpenAPI → paste http://localhost:8000/openapi.json
```

### 💡 Creative Use Cases (Partner Track)

| Use Case | How Requestly Helps |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Mocking Blockchain RPC** | Use Requestly's response override to mock MetaMask/Hardhat responses — test frontend without running a local chain |
| **Chaos Engineering** | Inject 500/429 errors into AI endpoints to validate retry logic and graceful degradation |
| **OAuth Token Injection** | Override auth headers to test doctor-patient access control flows without real MetaMask signing |
| **API Response Stubbing** | Mock Gemini/Tavus API responses locally — enables offline demo mode for hackathon presentations |
| **Sequential Workflow Testing** | Collection Runner validates the full patient journey: register → upload → analyze → chat → book → grant → revoke |
